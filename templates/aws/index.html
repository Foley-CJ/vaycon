  <h1 id="Intro"> NoSQL Databases Analysis: Twitter Utilization</h1>
  </br>
  <p>NoSQL databases have been gaining popularity ever since they first appeared in 1998.  Since then, multiple offerings have entered the space, each with a slightly different value proposition. Given the uniqueness of each system, it can be challenging to determine which product to deploy.  One dimension of that comparison  is the level of support and community.</p>
  <p>  In this analysis, we investigate the breadth of the community by evaluating how three of the most popular NoSQL databases utilize Twitter. More specifically, we evaluate MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Cassandra by pulling data with the Twitter API and investigating it with python's Plotly package.  </p>
</div>

<!-- First Context Block -->
<div class="container p-3 my-5 rounded bg-white text-dark ">
  </br>
  <h2 id="Summary"> High Level Product Summary </h2>
  </br>
  <p> To start this analysis, we begin by reviewing a few key facts about the three products. These key facts include the database's release date, when it joined Twitter, the number of followers, total tweets sent, and tweets sent within 2021.</p>

  <table class="table table-hover table-sm">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Database</th>
        <th scope="col">Initial Release</th>
        <th scope="col">Twitter Date</th>
        <th scope="col">Followers</th>
        <th scope="col">Total Tweets</th>
        <th scope="col">2021 Tweets</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Cassandra</th>
        <td>2008</td>
        <td>2009</td>
        <td>40.7K</td>
        <td>479</td>
        <td>117</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">DynamoDB</th>
        <td>2012</td>
        <td>2008</td>
        <td>16.5K</td>
        <td>6.3K</td>
        <td>1180</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
        <td>2009</td>
        <td>2008</td>
        <td>381.5K</td>
        <td>20.8K</td>
        <td>1601</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </br>
  <p> These figures reveal that neither release date nor tweet quantity alone can predict the number of followers, the key performance indicator that we're interested in exploring. Additionally, this data suggests that while DynamoDB and Cassandra have been less engaged than MongoDB, they are taking a more active role in 2021.  
  </p>

  </br>
  <h2 id="Tweets"> Tweets Sent: 2021 Analysis </h2>
  </br>
  <p> While the total number of tweets posted in 2021 per database is helpful breaking that figure down over the year will give a much richer view of how the databases are utilizing Twitter.  We start this breakdown by looking at all the tweets. These postings include public tweets, retweets, and directed tweets.  
  </p>

  {% include "charts/chart_dailyTweets_any.html" %}

  <p> This graph alone showcases some interesting behavior already such as the following:</p>
  <ui>
    <li> The most tweets sent on a single day occurred July 13th and November 9th. These two dates align with MongoDB.live and MongoDB.local, respectively.</li>
    <li> DynamoDB had the most consistent presence before September and would send at least one tweet each day, including weekends.</li>
  </ui>
</br>
  <p> When we break down the types of tweets specifically to original tweets, direct and public tweets, rather than retweets, a very different experience is revealed.</p>


  {% include "charts/chart_dailyTweets_dms.html" %}

  {% include "charts/chart_dailyTweets_public.html" %}
</br>
  <p> These two graphs showcase that MongoDB is the only database that has been actively reaching out to specific customers.  Additionally, DynamoDB had been the most active in posting public tweets, but that has since changed as of September.
  </br>
</div>



<!-- Third Context Block -->
<div class="container p-3 my-5 rounded bg-white text-dark ">
  </br>
  <h2 id="Favorites"> Favorites Recieved: 2021 Analysis </h2>
  </br>
  <p> While posting tweets is required to get your message out to your followers, a large follower base does not guarantee that the reception of the tweets will be positive.
  </p>
  <p> In this portion of the analysis, we review how Twitter's users feel about the postings the three databases have made in 2021 by examining the number of favorites the posts have received.  
  </p>


  {% include "charts/chart_dailyFavorites_public.html" %}

  <p>The table below represents the five most favorited tweets of 2021.</p>

 <table class="table table-hover table-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Database</th>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
      <th scope="col">Favorites</th>
      <th scope="col">Tweet Text</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2021-06-02</td>
      <td>1731</td>
      <td>What's the best programing language to learn?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2021-09-07</td>
      <td>1109</td>
      <td>If you weren't a developer, what would you be?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2021-10-13</td>
      <td>786</td>
      <td>"We've always used a RDB ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2021-08-20</td>
      <td>721</td>
      <td>When did you first know your career would be in tech?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2021-05-11</td>
      <td>698</td>
      <td>Laptop or Desktop?Single Display or many?</td>
    </tr>


  </tbody>
</table>
</br>
<p> While it's not surprising that MongoDB produced the most liked tweets in 2021, interestingly, four out of five of those tweets were questions to their followers.</p>
</br>
<p>Additionally, the distribution of favorites is paramount. Collecting 100 favorites over twenty tweets is less impactful than 100 favorites via one tweet. Trending and viral tweets allow penetration into the social network producing a substantial impact. </p>

<div class="container p-3 my-5 rounded bg-white text-dark ">
  </br>
  <h2 id="Results"> Results: 2021 Analysis </h2>
</br>
  <p> There are multiple takeaways and additional opportunities for further analysis surrounding this investigation. The three major takeaways from this analysis include:
  <ul>
      <li>MongoDB is effective at drawing engagement in the form of likes and growing its follower base by utilizing question-based tweets.</li>
       <li>Utilizing live events such as MongoDB.live or MondoDB.local in conjunction with Twitter works well to build a platform and extend the reach of that platform. AWS could leverage its AWS re:Invent conference to the same extent.</li>
       <li>Since September of this year, DynamoDBs tweets have significantly dropped off. This shift has allowed other communities to grow in their place.
       </li>
  </ul>

  <p>  Some additional opportunities and outstanding questions that should still be addressed as as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Do feature/product enhancement announcements draw an impactful engagement from Twitter followers?</li>
    <li> Does the sentiment or style of communications have a significant impact on the effectiveness of Twitter?</li>
    <li> Are there alternative social media applications that could provide a more valuable return on the amount of time invested?</li>
    <li>Does success in the Twitter community relate to success in the real community for the database?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ultimately this analysis revealed that MongoDB is using a variety of tactics to engage with its community, that social network dynamics is not a perfect science, and that all three products have opportunities to improve their community outreach.  </p>
