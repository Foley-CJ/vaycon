  <h1> NoSQL Databases Analysis: Twitter Utilization</h1>
  </br>
  <p>NoSQL databases have been gaining popularity ever since they first appeared in 1998.  Since that point, multiple offerings have entered the space each with a slightly different value proposition. Given the uniqueness of each offering, it can be difficult to detemine which product to deploy.  One dimension of that comparision that's more simple to evaluate is the level of support and community surrounding the offering.</br>
  </br>
  In this analysis we investigate that specific dimension by evaluating how each

the utlization of Twitter by three of those offerings: MongoDb, DynamoDb, and Casandra. in 2021 by Twitter API , Tweepy, Plotly, and Sentiment Analysis? </p>

<div class="container rounded bg-white text-dark ">
    </br>
  <h2> High Level Product Summary </h2>
</br>
  <p> To start this analysis we begin by reviewing a few key facts about the three products. These key facts include when the database was first made available, when it joined Twitter, the number of followers, total tweets sent, and tweets sent within 2021.

 <table class="table table-hover table-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Product</th>
      <th scope="col">Initial Release</th>
      <th scope="col">Twitter Date</th>
      <th scope="col">Followers</th>
      <th scope="col">Total Tweets</th>
      <th scope="col">2021 Tweets</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">DynamoDB</th>
      <td>2012</td>
      <td>2008</td>
      <td>16.5K</td>
      <td>6.3K</td>
      <td>1180</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
          <th scope="row">MongoDB</th>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>2008</td>
      <td>381.5K</td>
      <td>20.8K</td>
      <td>1601</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
           <th scope="row">Cassandra</th>
      <td>2008</td>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>40.7K</td>
      <td>479</td>
      <td>117</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
  </br>
  <p> These figures reveal that tenure nor the quantity of tweets alone can predict the number of followers: the key performance indicator that we're interested in exploring. However this data does reveal that both DynamoDB and Cassandra have taken

    , they do suggest that Cassandra is more active on twitter than it has been historically. 

    In order to reveal any insights deeper analysis is required.
